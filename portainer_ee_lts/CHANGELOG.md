## Version 2.34.0

### Add-on Changes

**IMPORTANT FIX:** Added `CSP=false` environment variable to fix Home Assistant ingress/iframe compatibility. Portainer 2.33.0+ introduced Content-Security-Policy headers that block iframe embedding, preventing access through Home Assistant's ingress. This fix disables those restrictive headers to restore functionality.

If you're experiencing issues accessing Portainer through Home Assistant after updating to 2.34.0, you'll need to rebuild and restart the add-on for this fix to take effect.
