A fancy, easy-to-use and reactive self-hosted docker compose.yaml stack-oriented manager.

## About

Dockge is a self-hosted, easy-to-use Docker Compose stack manager. It provides a web interface to manage your Docker Compose stacks with features like an interactive YAML editor, web terminal, and real-time updates. This add-on brings Dockge to Home Assistant, integrating it seamlessly with the sidebar.

- üîÑ Real-time Updates: See container status changes instantly
- üê≥ Docker Compose Management: Start, stop, restart stacks easily
- üîß Convert Docker Run: Convert `docker run` commands to compose.yaml
- üíæ Persistent data storage included in backups
- üéØ Ingress support for seamless sidebar integration
- üè∑Ô∏è Option to hide Home Assistant system containers

## Installation

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant instance
2. Search for "Dockge" in the add-on store
3. Click Install
4. Configure the add-on options (if needed)
5. Start the add-on
6. Click "OPEN WEB UI" or access via the sidebar

## Configuration

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`: Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

### Option: `stacks_dir`

The directory where Docker Compose stacks will be stored. Default is `/opt/stacks`.
All stacks are automatically included in Home Assistant backups.

### Option: `hide_hassio_containers`

When enabled (default), hides Home Assistant system containers from the Dockge
interface. This includes supervisor, core, audio, dns, multicast, cli, observer,
and addon containers.

## Folder Access

This addon has access to the following Home Assistant directories:

- `/data` - Addon persistent data (read/write)
- `/share` - Home Assistant share folder (read/write)

These folders are accessible from within Dockge and can be used for stack storage or volume mounts.

## First Time Setup

1. When you first access Dockge, you'll be presented with the main dashboard
2. Click "Compose" or the "+" button to create a new stack
3. Enter your docker-compose.yaml configuration
4. Click "Deploy" to start the stack

## Docker Socket Access

This add-on requires access to the Docker socket to manage containers. For security,
ensure you understand the implications of granting Docker access to this addon.

## Known Issues and Limitations

- **Console Feature**: As of Dockge 1.5.0, the console/terminal feature is disabled
  by default for security. Since this addon uses the official Docker image, enabling
  the console would require building a custom image with `DOCKGE_ENABLE_CONSOLE=true`
- Full Docker socket access is required
- Ingress port must be set to 5001 (default)

## Updating the Add-on

An update script is included to check for new Dockge versions:

```bash
# Check for updates only
/config/addons/dockge/update-dockge-version.sh --check-only

# Apply update
/config/addons/dockge/update-dockge-version.sh --yes
```
